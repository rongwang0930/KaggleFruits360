# Imagge Classification Using Pytorch CNN Model.
## Description:
Design and implement a CNN ML model to train images and make image classification on Kaggle dataset fruits 360 dataset.

## Dataset: Fruits 360
A dataset of images containing fruits and vegetables https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits

# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
You'll want to be comfortable with below theories:
* convolutional layers
* filters/kernels
* pooling
* depth, stride and zero-padding

# Development Environments
* Language: Python
* Development Tools: Juypter Notebook
* Framework: Pytorch

# Result:
#### Achived 94.288% accuracy on 22688 Test Dataset with 2 CNN layers.
#### 70s items identified incorrectly among a 5000 beatch size Test Images
